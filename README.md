# Matrix Multiplication Experiments

This repository contains implementations and benchmarking functions for the Matrix Multiplication Assignment.

MatrixList.py contains the implementation of the row-major order, flat list Matrix implementation, 
as well as different algorithms for Matrix Multiplication and auxiliary functions.

Experiments can be replicated by cloning the repository and running the following (requires PyPy 3.7):

1) Benchmarking the Optimal Parameter 

```
pypy Optimal_Param.py
```
2) Benchmarking the transpose operation of a Matrix

```
pypy Measure_Transpose.py
```

3) Benchmarking runtime all algorithms

```
pypy Horse_Race.py
```
