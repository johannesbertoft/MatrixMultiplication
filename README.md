# Matrix Multiplication 

This project is the final assignment of the course Applied Algorithms in the MSc in Software Design at IT University of Copenhagen.

The repository contains implementations and benchmarking functions for various Matrix Multiplication techniques. 

## Implementation and Report

[MatrixList.py](MatrixList.py) contains an implementation of the row-major order, flat list Matrix implementation, 
as well as different algorithms for Matrix Multiplication and auxiliary functions. [Benchmark.py](Benchmark.py) shows some of the utility functions used to benchmark the various matrix multiplication functions, and further experiments-related code can be found in [experiments_code](experiments_code).

The [Report](applied_algorithms_final_project_daniel_johannes.pdf) describes the aim of the assignment and the
analysis of results based on the Ideal Cache Model. 

## What I learned?

* Implementing, testing and benchmarking algorithms for various input sizes and parameters
* Understanding the Ideal Cache Model, analysing cache-aware and cache-oblivious algorithms
* Algorithm analysis and tuning
