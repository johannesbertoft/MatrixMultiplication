Notes

# Task 1 - complete

Elementary algorithm. Useful to check the correctness of more complicated algorithms

# Task 2 - Complete

Inplace transposed version, measure runtime of transposing Inplace

# Task 3 - Complete

Elementary algorithm assuming one operand transposed, discuss cache model.

# Task 4 - Complete

Tiled implementation, 3 nested loops and call to Elementary

# Task 5 - complete

Decide on the best parameter s for Tiled. Fix n and discuss choice of n.
Run experiments on s from 2 to n/2. Discuss results.

# Task 6 - complete

Repeat experiment from task 5 with different n

# Task 7 Complete

# Task 8 Complete

# Task 9 complete

Decide on the best parameter for fall back to elementary algorithm. Fix n to suitable value 
discuss results

# Task 10 Complete

# Task 11 complete

Decide on best parameter for elementary algorithm, fix n, repeat with different n.
